## Live edit MDX with the RequestResp🐛

Did you know you can create and update stories directly inside Storybook? That feature is powered by the RequestResponse API, which lets the manager React app send requests to the main Node.js app.

* Fetching data from a remote API and injecting it in your story tags

Let's first see the general architecture of RequestResponse, and then we'll build🐛
